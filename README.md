# Weather Dashboard

## Description

Weather Dashboard that displays the current weather and five-day forecast. When the document loads to the browser, the application either automatically renders weather data for the user's current location or renders content based on a previous search. The user may also search for a location or choose to select a major city located under the search bar with the latter option being unavailable for small screen sizes.
